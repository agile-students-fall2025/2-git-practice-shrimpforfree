Inter-process communication (IPC) began as a way for programs running on the same computer to share data and coordinate tasks with each otehr using pipes and message queues. Over time, the message passing between independent processesâ€”was extended beyond a single machine. It later transform into the network protocols that let applications talk across the Internet today.
